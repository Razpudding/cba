## Projects

### Kobo data to A11yJSON standard
[kobo-a11yjson](/) Converts Kobo survey data to A11yJSON.
It uses the typescript interfaces provided by SozialHelden and outputs A11yJSON data with some additional fields relevant to this project.

### A11yJSON diagram
[a11yjson-diagram](/a11yjson-diagram) A useful diagram which shows a visual nesting of A11yJSON interfaces. Currently only the interfaces I need are included.

### Extracting interfaces
[extracting-interfaces](/extracting-interfaces)A dirty hack to get all A11yJSON interfaces
